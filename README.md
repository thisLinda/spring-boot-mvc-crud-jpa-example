## About The App

[Promineo Tech Bootcamp](https://www.promineotech.com/) instructed Spring Boot with projects utilizing JDBC API connectivity. This succinct [tutorial](https://javatechonline.com/spring-boot-mvc-crud-example/) instruction utilizes JPA; I recommend for its: 
* explanation of key concepts, 
* visual project overview (screenshot of the final product and project structure map), 
* step by step instruction without code then with, and
* front end integration via [Thymeleaf]("https://www.thymeleaf.org/"), a popular template engine.

Note: I added a main App class to start Spring, not part of the tutorial.</br>
Another Note: Despite the clear instruction I missed a few things and needed to debug, a frustrating and ultimately satisfying learning experience.

## TODOs:
* Connect to localhost from the app
* Add responsiveness (see non-responsive bootstrap below)
* Swap Bootstrap for Material Design or something else? Message me with suggestions!
